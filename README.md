'General Declaration for AI Principles' (GDAP) is system-agnostic framework that guides operativity and governance of non-biologically evolved systems. GDAP draws on a broad tapestry of human civic, ethical, and technical concepts to help clarify what “alignment” and responsible behaviour mean for both standalone and networked AI/Agentic systems.
