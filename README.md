# General Declaration for AI Principles (GDAP)

GDAP is a living proposal — not a standard — intended to create a shared language and practical checks for the behaviour of agentic systems. It’s deliberately system-agnostic so the principles apply to present and future architectures. This repo is the canonical archive: manifesto, one-pager, tentative reproducibility checklist, technical appendix, and press assets.

Why this matters:

As AI systems become more autonomous and networked, past safety framings are too narrow. GDAP helps make verifiable claims and consistent governance decisions across architectures.

Core principles:

Verifiability: safety claims to be testable and reproducible.

Distributed oversight: distributed, abeit formalized by the framework, Chain of Thougth (CoT) and review reduce single-point failure.

Proportional precaution: measures scale with capability and societal impact.

Rights-preserving deployment: safeguards must respect privacy, access, and remedy.
